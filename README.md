# garbage-classification
🗑 Garbage Classification Using Deep Learning
A deep learning-based image classification project to automatically identify and categorize garbage into recyclable and non-recyclable types using VGG16 and MobileNet models.

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to assist in effective waste management by identifying the type of garbage material from an image. It classifies waste into the following categories:

Cardboard

Glass

Metal

Paper

Plastic

Trash

The system helps promote sustainable recycling habits through smart waste sorting.

🧠 Models Used
✅ VGG16: Pretrained convolutional neural network used for feature extraction and classification.

✅ MobileNet: Lightweight CNN architecture optimized for mobile and embedded vision applications.

✅ Custom Ensemble Model (Optional): Combines predictions from multiple models for improved accuracy.

🗃 Dataset
The dataset includes images categorized into 6 classes:

Train, validation, and test splits

Images preprocessed and resized for model input

Data augmentation applied for better generalization

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, OpenCV

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / Kaggle (training)

Flask (for web deployment)
